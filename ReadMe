Circuit Pro Industries M0 DC Closed Loop Servo

   read a rotary encoder with interrupts
   Encoder hooked up with common to GROUND,
   encoder0PinA to pin 2, encoder0PinB to pin 4 (or pin 3 see below)
   it doesn't matter which encoder pin you use for A or B 
   
   is possible to change PID costants by sending on SerialUSB interfaces the values separated by ',' in this order: KP,KD,KI
   example: 5.2,3.1,0 so we have  KP=5.2 KD=3.1 KI=0 is only for testing purposes, but i will leave this function with eeprom storage
